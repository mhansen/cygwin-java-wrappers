Java wrappers for cygwin. The idea: use them as you would java on *nix.

The java utilities on windows accept windows paths, so there's an impedance mismatch if you want to develop on cygwin. These scripts convert the *nix paths to windows paths, and java is happy.

The script uses the JAVA_HOME environment variable to find your java directory (e.g. /cygdrive/c/program files/java)

Install by running with "make install". Defaults to installing to /usr/bin
